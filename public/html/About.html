            Hey, My name is Erik and I'm an looking to start my career in IT by completing my Google IT Support professinal Certificate.
            I also like to code every once in a while which is why this website exists. But also to show that I am able to configure and host a website online.
            Check out my project tab to learn more about how I did that.
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway... go ahead and look around (not much to see at the moment) and try out my Image gathering app.
