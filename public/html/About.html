            Hi, my name is Erik. I'm just a guy... a guy who likes making stuff like this website!
            Other interests include traveling, cars, electronics, music, movies, kites, dogs and game nights.
            <br>
            <br>
            So why did I make this website? Well because I was bored and I wanted to create a web app that 
            allows me to download a bunch of Images from reddit without much effort. The irony is that making 
            the app took way longer then I'd like to admit... 
            <br>
            <br>
            Anyway... maybe one day I'd like to get a developer job so this website will be a hub to display my work.
            All my work including this website can also be found on my <a class="githubLink" href="https://github.com/Lumina97">github</a>
