                Short explanation about my Image gatherer! You enter any Reddit that you want to scan for posts with
                images attached as well as how many posts you want to scan (max is 200) and you can also add some
                filter which are
                applied to the title of the posts.
                <br>
                It then takes the given information, checks if the Reddit is valid, downloads the posts, checks if
                there is an Image attached to the post,
                applies filters to the title of the post, then downloads every image that was found, places it in
                the same folder using the session ID, creates a ZIP file from the folder and sends it to the client
                to download (it comes up as a pop up).
