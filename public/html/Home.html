                Welcome to my website which serves as a central display of my projects.

                Short explanation about my Image gatherer! You enter any Reddit that you want to scan for posts with
                images attached as well as how many posts you want to scan (max is 100) and you can also add some
                filters which are applied to the title of the posts.
                <br>
                <br>
                It then takes the given information, checks if the Reddit is valid, downloads the posts, checks if
                there is an Image attached to the post,
                applies filters to the title of the post, returns all the image links that were found and sends them to the user.                
                <br>
                <br>
                User can then look at them in the collection view with previews and click on images for a full scale preview. 
                They can then either download all images or download only selected. The user can also favorite images and the 
                links will be saved to local storage.
