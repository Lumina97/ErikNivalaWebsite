                    Short explanation about my Image gatherer! You enter any Reddit that you want to scan for posts with
                    images attached as well as how many posts you want to scan (max is 200) and you can also add some
                    filter which are
                    applied to the title of the posts.
                    <br>
                    It then takes the given information, checks if the Reddit is valid, downloads the posts, checks if
                    there is an Image attached to the post,
                    applies filters to the title of the post, then downloads every image that was found, places it in
                    the same folder using the session ID, creates a ZIP file from the folder and sends it to the client
                    to download (it comes up as a pop up).

            <h1>Website</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    The website is hosted on an Orangepi-5 which is running a verion of linux.
                    In order to protect myself I did not open any ports to the internet but rather I am using
                    a service called cloudflare which acts as a reverse proxy hosting my page online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bought my own domain from google domains and used that for cloudflare to redirect my traffic.
                    In order for that to work I had to use the cloudflare DNS servers which I simply added to the Google
                    domain for my website to be found online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am using node with a couple npm packages to run the page, using sessionsID's to determine every
                    user
                    in order to send them the right zip file for my image gatherer.
                    Any changes to the page are tested on my local machine before being committed and pushed to github
                    and
                    ultimately being pulled to the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am running apache2 on the server and redirecting any traffic to port 80 over to port 3000 where a
                    service running my node server is listening.
