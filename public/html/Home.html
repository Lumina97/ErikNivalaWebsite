                    Short explanation about my Image gatherer! You enter any Reddit that you want to scan for posts with
                    images attached as well as how many posts you want to scan (max is 200) and you can also add some
                    filter which are
                    applied to the title of the posts.
                    <br>
                    It then takes the given information, checks if the Reddit is valid, downloads the posts, checks if
                    there is an Image attached to the post,
                    applies filters to the title of the post, then downloads every image that was found, places it in
                    the same folder using the session ID, creates a ZIP file from the folder and sends it to the client
                    to download (it comes up as a pop up).

        <article id="Website" style="display: none;">
            <h1>Website</h1>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Welcome to the more technical explanation of my website!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website is hosted on an Orangepi-5 which is running a verion of linux.
                    In order to protect myself I did not open any ports to the internet but rather I am using
                    a service called cloudflare which acts as a reverse proxy hosting my page online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I bought my own domain from google domains and used that for cloudflare to redirect my traffic.
                    In order for that to work I had to use the cloudflare DNS servers which I simply added to the Google
                    domain for my website to be found online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website utilized sessions which are stored in a MongoDB on the same orangepi as the website. I
                    wanted to have the DB running
                    on my orangepi-3 but it seems that its running an ARM64 architecture with a lower microarchitecture
                    then what mongoDB supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a linode server that checks uptime for my website response and my ImageGatherer post request.
                    It checks if the website itself is up every 30 seconds and it sends a post request for the
                    ImageGatherer
                    every 60 seconds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have the exact same setup on my orangepi-3 as my main website "server" in order to test any
                    changes to the website on a linux based system
                    since I do develop on windows and want to make sure everything works on both platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have more plans for this website which I have outlined on my <a
